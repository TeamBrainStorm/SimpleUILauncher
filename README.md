# SimpleUILauncher

Simple UI Launcher is an android launcher that I have been working on in my spare time and now don't have as much time to add new features to it so I am open sourcing it. Itâ€™s based off on AOSP launcher 3 but shows all apps in paged view mode like on Huawei android devices.

What it does right now: 



shows all apps in paged view mode (no app drawer is there) 
shows app preview in folder displaying 9 icons instead of 4

Features I need help adding: 


Icon pack support (Top on the list to be added!) 
The ability to enable app drawer mode in the settings of the launcher (I kept launcher 3's code in the project so this should be easy to implement!)

I am open to any types of feedback and suggestions!

if you are interested in helping with this project please email me at devs4apps@gmail.com with your skillset!

Thanks for looking have a great day!
